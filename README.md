This Application is a grade estimation application with machine learning used by university students
to better understand the grades they are likely to receive based on their attendance to lectures,
time spent studying and other aspects of their study life. It uses a login system to determine who
is currently using the app and has feedback forms available so that more accurate grades for each
class can be given. For example, if many students struggle with a certain class, they can report
that in the feedback and grades for future students will be estimated slightly lower than previously.
