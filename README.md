This Application is a grade estimation application used by university students to better 
understand the grades they are likely to receive based on their attendance to lectures, 
time spent studying and other aspects of their study life. It will use a login system to 
determine who is currently using the app and have feedback forms available so that more 
accurate grades for each class can be given. For example, if many students struggle with 
a certain class, they can report that in the feedback and grades for future students will 
be estimated slightly lower than previously.
